      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Fixed size memory blocks may be larger than 64KB on 32bit CPUs.<br>
          The fixed size memory pool data types were modified to allow larger pools and block sizes on 32bit CPUs. The sizes may now be up to 2^31 bytes.<br>
          For 16bit CPUs the block and pool sizes remain unchanged to previous versions and may be 64KB.
        </li>
        <li>Software timer handling can be excluded.<br>
          The new compile-time switch OS_SUPPORT_TIMER may be used to exclude embOS software timer handling from build when compiling the sources.<br>
          If software timer are not needed by the application, excluding the software timer handling will decrease code and data size and speed up the scheduler.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82t</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Trial time limitation increased to 12 hours.<br>

          OS_SuspendAllTasks() may be used to suspend all task except the running task.<br>
          OS_SetInitialSuspendCnt() can be used to create tasks that are initially suspended and will not run until they are resumed.<br>
          OS_ResumAllSuspendedTasks() may be used to resume all suspended task at once without the need to address specific tasks.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82l</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Thread local storage supported.<br>
          For some ports, a thread local storage (TLS) may be used and can be initialized individually for every task by a call of OS_TLS_Init().<br>
          The new TLS implementation requires additional CPU specifc fucntions and support by the compiler specific runtime library, it may be available for some ports only.
        </li>

          The new function OS_Delayus() can be used to perform a delay with micro second resolution. The calling task will wait for the given delay time without suspension.<br>
          During the wait time, other tasks may be activated by interrupt, the embOS scheduling is not blocked.<br>
          The function works well when the embOS timer has a resolution of at least 1us or better.
        </li>
        <li>New API function OS_Q_Delete().<br>
          This new function deletes a queue. Queues can be fully dynamically created and deleted now. The resources of the queue may be re-used after deletion.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82g</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Start() in assembly source replaced by OS_StartASM().<br>
        OS_Start() now is a generic function which sets OS_Running to 1 and then calls OS_StartASM().</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82h</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Internal data types modified.<br>
          A data type was defined for Ipl_EI and Ipl_DI. This allows variable size of integers which is supported by some tool chains.
        </li>
        <li>OS_Info module modifed.<br>
          The OS_Info module included the standard header stdio.h without any need. The include is removed now.

      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82g</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Start() in assembly source replaced by OS_StartASM().<br>
        OS_Start() now is a generic function which sets OS_Running to 1 and then calls OS_StartASM().</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82f</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_IsRunning() implemented.<br>
          The new API function OS_IsRunning() can be used to examine whether the embOS scheduler was started by a call of OS_Start().<br>
          This may be helpful for some applications and functions to decide whether blocking function calls can be used.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82a</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">

      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Scheduling and task switch time optimized.<br>
          The internal scheduling functions OS_ChangeTask() and OS_Switch() were optimized to speed up context switching.<br>
          By recompiling the sources, the optimization may be enabled or disabled by the definition of OS_GLOBAL_IS_RETURNED and OS_GLOBAL_IS_PARA.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80l</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Macro OS_U32_TO_PTR_TYPE  added.<br>
        The new macro OS_U32_TO_PTR_TYPE casts an OS_U32 to pointer type to avoid warnings on some tool chains with different memory models.
        </li>
        <li>New macro OS_EI_HP_ON_ENTRY()<br>
        OS_EI_HP_ON_ENTRY() enables high-prio interrupts if necessary: Some CPUs (such as M16C) disable all interrupts on ISR entry. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80k</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>New fast tick handler.<br>
          embOS V3.80k comes with an alternate faster tick handler OS_TICK_HandleNoHook().<br>
          This tick handler does not support the tick hook function and therefore executes faster.<br>
          It may be used instead of the regular tick handler OS_TICK_Handle() which is used in the default start projects.<br>
          When using this new fast tick handler, it is the users responsibility, not to install any tick hook functions, as those will not be called by embOS.
        </li>
        <li>Task events modified.<br>
          The data type of task events may now be modified from unsigned char to unsigned short or unsigned int to allow more than 8 task events.<br>
          The modification is done be defining the type of task events via the OS_TASK_EVENT definition in RTOS.h<br>
          This type defaults to unsigned char to be compatible with previous versions of embOS. A modification requires recompilation of the embOS sources.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80h</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Interrupt entry functions modified, internal modification.<br>
          For some CPUs the CPU state can not be examined. A modification of the interrupt entry functions was required to inhibit an interrupt level assertion, introduced with version 3.80f, for those CPUs.<br>
          The performance is not affected by this modification.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80f</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Interrupt level assertions added<br>
          The debug version of embOS now comes with additional error handler functionality.<br>
          The error handler can detect illegal function calls under various conditions. OS_Error() will be called when one of the following conditions is detected:<br>
          <ul>
          <li>OS_ERR_NOT_IN_ISR:            *** OS_EnterInterrupt() has been called, but CPU is not in ISR state</li>
          <li>OS_ERR_IN_ISR:                *** OS_EnterInterrupt() has not been called, but CPU is in ISR state</li>
          <li>OS_ERR_CPU_STATE_ISR_ILLEGAL: *** OS-function called from ISR with high priority</li>
          <li>OS_ERR_CPU_STATE_ILLEGAL:     *** CPU runs in illegal mode</li>
          <li>OS_ERR_CPU_STATE_UNKNOWN:     *** CPU runs in unknown mode or mode could not be read</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.62a</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_STACK_ALIGN implemented<br>
          OS_STACK_ALIGN may be defined to ensure a specific task stack alignment during task creation.<br>
          To ensure a stack alignment of 8 bytes, OS_STACK_ALIGN has to be defined to 8 in the CPU specific embOS internal header file OS_Priv.h.<br>
          Modification of this define requires recompilation of the embOS libraries.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.62</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_TICK_Config() and OS_TICK_HandleEx() implemented<br>
          The extended embOS tick handler was modified to handle a runtime configurable tick increment and fractions.<br>
          These parameter are setup by the new OS_TICK_Config() function and may be re configured during runtime.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.60d</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_POWER module implemented.<br>
          The OS_POWER module may be used to control different power saving modes when entering idle state.<br>
          Individual flags for different peripherals may be set whenever a peripheral needs power or clock, and may be reset, when power is not needed.<br>
          The state of the power flags may be examined during OS_Idle by a call of OS_POWER_GetMask().<br>
          This allows to switch off all of those peripherals which are not needed during idle times.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.60a</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>embOS trial versions may run an unlimited number of tasks.<br>
          The embOS trial versions run unlimited as long as only 3 tasks are created.<br>
          Since version 3.60a, a time limit is added to the trial version. During the first 15 minutes, an unlimited number of tasks can be created.<br>
          If more than three tasks were created during the time limit time, the system stops and calls OS_Error() when the time limit exceeded.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.60</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_AddTickHook() and OS_RemoveTickHook() implemented.<br>
          These new functions allow the application to add and remove user function calls (hook functions) to the OS timer tick handler.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.52c</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_SetTaskName() introduced<br>
          OS_SetTaskName() allows modification of task names on the fly.<br>
          This may be useful if the functionality of a task changes during runtime and the new state should be shown using embOSView or an other task visualization tool.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.52</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_CallISR() and OS_CallNestableISR() introduced<br>
          These new functions are required for some specific CPUs, but may be used in general to call an interrupt handler function without the need of using OS_EnterInterrupt() / OS_LeaveInterrupt() in the handler function.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.50b</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>New library mode XR allows extremely compact applications<br>
          The new XR libraries may be used to build extremely compact applications to save space in RAM and ROM and speed up context switching time.<br>
          The XR embOS libraries are compiled with round robin scheduling disabled and task names disabled, which results in smaller data structures, smaller code size and faster context switching time.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.40c</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Yield() may suspend a task unconditionally<br>
          When tasks are running on round robin with timeslice, the function OS_Yield() can be used to end the timeslice of the running task immediately and activate an other task with the same priority which is ready for execution.
          The function has no effect on tasks that are not running on round robin.          
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.40</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Task switch time can be measured by application<br>
          embOS now comes with sample applications which allow accurate measurement of task switch time in a running application.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32o</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Automatic call of OS_INIT_SYS_LOCKS() removed.<br>
          During initialization of embOS, OS_INIT_SYS_LOCK() is not called automatically.<br>
          As most of the applications do not need thread safe system libraries, an automatic activation of syslocks causes unwanted overhead.<br>
          If supported and required, the user may call OS_INIT_SYS_LOCKS() from his own application after normal initialization of embOS.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32m</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_TimerEx, Extended timer implemented<br>
          Extended timers are software timers which call a user defined callback function when the timer expires.<br>
          In comparison to normal embOS timers, a parameter is passed to the timer callback function.<br>
          The parameter value is initialized during timer creation.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32j</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_CSemaRequest implemented<br>
          May be used to decrement a counting semaphore conditionally, if a signal is available.<br>
          The function never blocks the calling task and delivers a result which indicates whether the semaphore was available.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32f</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_INIT_SYS_LOCKS() implemented<br>
          May be used to include initialization code for thread safe system libraries.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32d</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Q_GetPtrTimed() implemented<br>
          New queue retrieval function which waits for a message with specified timeout.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32c</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_EVENT_WaitTimed() implemented<br>
          New event object function to wait for an event with a timeout limit.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32b</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Task context modified for debug builds<br>
          The number of task activations is now part of the task context in debug builds.<br>
          The number of activations are therefore displayed in the task list window of embOS plugin, when an embOS debug library is used.<br>
          Previous versions of embOS showed this information in profiling builds only.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32a</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>A parameter may be passed to a task function<br>
          Using the new embOS functions OS_CREATETASK_EX() or OS_CreateTaskEx() allows to pass a void pointer as parameter to a task.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.32</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Event objects introduced<br>
          Event objects are standalone objects which are not assigned to a specific task.<br>
          Event objects may be used to synchronize one or multiple task to a specific event.<br>
          Events can be triggered from a task, a timer, or an interrupt handler.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.30a</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>embOS internal time handling modified to allow long delays<br>
          For 8- and 16-bit CPUs the maximum range for delays and timer periods is limited to 32767 embOS timer ticks, because time comparison ist done by integer calculation.<br>
          By recompiling sources with data type OS_TIME defined as signed long, longer delays and timer periods up to 2147483647 ticks can be realized.<br>
          The embOS libraries of object versions for 8- and 16-bit CPUs are still delivered with the limitation to 32767 timer ticks.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.28p</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>New error handling for version without round robin scheduling<br>
          In debug versions of embOS, OS_Error() is called with error code OS_ERR_TASK_PRIORITY, if a task is created with a priority which is already assigned to an other task.<br>
          OS_Error() is also called with the same error code, if a task priority is assigned by call of OS_SetPriority() and the new priority is already assigned to an other task.<br>
          Round robin switching can be disabled by recompiling sources with OS_RR_SUPPORTED defined as 0.
        </li>

      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Software timer handling optimized.<br>
          The software timer handler was removed form the scheduler and put into a separate module.<br>
          If software timer are not used by the application, the software timer handler will not be linked in, thus reducing the required kernel code size.
        </li>
        <li>Generic timer tick handler modified.<br>
        The preprocessor conditional defines to guarantee safe code for processors which can not perform atomic 32bit calculations or pointer operations was modifed.<br>
        This is an internal modification which has no effect on any current embOS port.
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82s</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Nestable interrupt handling improved.<br>
        Some embOS functions might have inhibited re-enabling of interrupts when a nestable interrupt was called during task suspension caused by the function.<br>
        The following API functions were affected and have been modified to correct this behavior:<br>
        OS_WaitEvent()<br>
        OS_WaitEventTimed()<br>
        OS_WaitSingleEvent()<br>
        OS_WaitSingelEventTimed()<br>

      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Thread local storage handling improved.<br>
        For embOS ports which support thread local storage, the task switch time was slightly increased, even for tasks which did not use thread local storage.<br>
        The implementation of thread local storage now is improved and does not affect the context switch time of tasks which do not use thread local storage.
        </li>
        <li>OS_TLS_Init() contains a new assertion.<br>
        OS_TLS_Init() must not be called multiple times from the same task.<br>
        In debug builds of embOS, the new implementation of OS_TLS_Int() now calls the OS_Error() function with error code OS_ERR_TLS_INIT when OS_TLS_Init() is called multiple times from the same task.
        </li>
        <li>OS_Terminate() contains a new assertion.<br>
        OS_Terminate() must not be called from an embOS software timer callback function.<br>
        In debug builds of embOS, the new implementation of OS_Terminate() now calls the OS_Error() function with error code OS_ERR_ILLEGAL_IN_TIMER when OS_Terminate() is called from an embOS timer.
        </li>
        <li>OS_ExtendTaskContext() contains a new assertion.<br>
        For every task, the context can be extended only once.<br>
        In debug builds of embOS, the new implementation of OS_ExtendTaskContext() now calls the OS_Error() function with the new error code OS_ERR_EXTEND_CONTEXT when OS_ExtendTaskContext() is called multiple times from the same task.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82q</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_EnterNestableInterrupt() optimized to reduce interrupt latency.<br>
        OS_EnterNestableInterrupt() caused some interrupt latency for zero latency interrupts when an embOS debug library was used.<br>
        Only CPUs which disable interrupts on interrupt entry were affected, for example Renesas M16C / M32C.<br>
        OS_EnterNestableInterrupt() for those CPUs was optimized to reduce the interrupt latency of high priority interrupts.

      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82p</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Suspend() now contains an assertion<br>
        OS_Suspend() must not be called from an interrupt handler as it could cause a task switch immediately.<br>
        In debug versions of embOS, OS_Suspend() now runs into OS_Error() if called from an interrupt handler or timer.
        </li>
        <li>OS_PutMail functions parameter declaration changed.<br>
        The functions OS_Putmail(), OS_PutMailCond, OS_PutMailFront() and OS_PutMailFrontCond() now have a const pointer qualifier for the data that shall be put into the mailbox.<br>
        The const qualifier clarifies and ensures that the data is not modifed by the function.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82k</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Queue management optimized.<br>
        Previous versions of embOS needed 2 integer words of mamangement information stored into the queue buffer for every data item in the queue.<br>
        With verion 3.82k, the data management was optimized and only one additional integer word, the data size, is stored into the buffer together with the data.

      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82i</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_StartTimer() modified to avoid warnings under GCC when compiling sources.<br>
        When compiling sources with optimization under GCC, the code in OS_StartTimer() generated a &quot;strict alias violation&quot; warning.<br>
        Some casts were removed and one pointer type was modified to eliminate this warning.

      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.82e</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Stack overflow check for system stack and interrupt stack added.<br>
        In stack check builds, embOS now checks the system stack and the interrupt stack (if present) during every call of the scheduler.<br>
        If a stack overflow is detected, the error handler OS_Error() is called with one of the new error codes OS_ERR_SYS_STACK or OS_ERR_INT_STACK.

        <li>Communication functions for embOSView may be used from tasks.<br>
          The embOS internal communication functions for embOSView, OS_OnRx() and OS_OnTx() may now be called from a task.<br>
          Previous versions of embOS did not allow calling these functions from outside an interrupt handler and called OS_Error() in debug builds.<br>
          Right now, theses functions and the communication protocol are not documented. The user should not call these functions.<br>
          The modification was done for future extensions.

          OS_Use() and OS_Unuse() were optimized to allow faster locking and unlocking on rersource semaphores.<br>
          The embOS scheduler was optimized to allow faster activation of tasks waiting on resources semaphores.
        </li><br>
        <li>Support for CPUs with growing stack addresses supported.<br>
          To handle CPUs with growing stack addresses, OS_CreateTask() and OS_CreateTaskEx() were modified.
          The compile time switch OS_STACK_AT_BOTTOM is now honored by these functions and stack is handled correctly for those CPUs.<br>
          Existing embOS version are not affected, this modification was made for newer versions for CPUs with growing stack addresses.

      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>embOS internal semaphores can be shown with the embOS plugin for IAR C-Spy.<br>
          The embOS plugin for IAR did not show the system locking semaphores used for malloc and other non re-entrant system functions when no other resource semaphores were used in the application.<br>
          These semaphores can be now be seen in the Resource semaphore window of the embOS C-Spy plugin.

      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.80</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>OS_Suspend() / OS_Resume() optimized.<br>
          The OS_Suspend() and OS_Resume() functions were optimized to perform faster task switches on 32bit CPUs.
        </li><br>
        <li>Internal data structures and scheduler optimized.<br>
          Internal data structures were modified to allow more efficient access. Together with a modification of the scheduler, this results in faster task switches and interrupt handling.
        </li><br>
        <li>OS_InitKern() does not enable interrupts.<br>
          The previous OS_InitKern() function enabled interrupts by a call of OS_RestoreI(), thus enabling interrupts, as long as OS_IncDI() was not called before.<br>
          The new OS_InitKern() function does not automatically enable interrupts. The interrupt enable state remains unchanged.
        </li><br>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.62c</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>New error code OS_ERR_IDLE_RETURNS<br>
          The debug version of embOS now checks whether OS_Idle() returns in which case OS_Error() is called with the new error code.<br>
          OS_Idle() has to be implemented as an endless loop and must never return. If OS_Idle() is modified and returns by accident, the behavior is unpredictable and this error might be difficult to find.<br>
          The new version of embOS now catches a return from OS_Idle() and calls OS_Error().
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.62b</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>New error code OS_ERR_ISR_NO_HANDLER<br>
          The new error code is generated and OS_Error() is called, if an un-initialized interrupt handler is called.<br>
          This error handling is available on some ports of embOS, especially those, where embOS initializes an interrupt vector table in RAM.<br>
          During initialization, a default dummy handler is installed for all interrupt sources. This handler should normally be replaced by installing application specific interrupt handlers.<br>
          Because the default dummy interrupt handler should never be called by an application, it calls OS_Error() with the new error code OS_ERR_ISR_NO_HANDLER to signal the setup error.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="heading2">Version 3.62</h2>
      <ol class="maintext">
        <li>Internal representation of scheduler states modified.<br>
          The states which control pending task switches and show the reason of the task switch are handled in compact structure now.<br>
          The previous version used bit fields and definitions which were difficult to understand and which were difficult to handle.<br>
          The new definition and structure is easier to handle which results in faster code execution.

        <li>OS_ERR_WRONG_STACK error code added.<br>
          Some ports of embOS for CPUs with different stack pointers require that the CPU enters main() with a specific stack selected.<br>
          These ports of embOS now contain code to examine the stack used in main and call OS_error() with the new error code OS_ERR_WRON_STACK, if the startup code entered main with the wrong stack-pointer selected.

        <li>OS_ASSERT_INIT_CALLED()<br>
          A new assertion is added which checks whether OS_InitKern() was called before tasks are created.<br>
          In debug builds, the OS_Error() function will be called, if tasks are created before calling OS_InitKern().
        </li><br>
        <li>OS_GetTaskName() modified.<br>
          In previous versions, OS_GetTaskName() had to be called with a valid task ID. Now, the NULL pointer may be passed as argument to address the current task.<br>
          The function will always return a valid string.<br>
          The previous implementation might have returned a NULL pointer, which could cause problems, if the result was not evaluated be the calling function.

        <li>OS_ASSERT_ISR_LEVEL()<br>
          A new assertion was defined which will call OS_Error() if the CPU runs in interrupt mode but OS_EnterInterrupt() or OS_EnterNestableInterrupt() was not called.<br>
          With version 3.60b the assertion is not implemented, it is just defined and usage is prepared. The implementation will be made in future versions of embOS.

           On 8 or 16 bit CPUs with high interrupt load, the scheduler might have failed when an interrupt occured during a resource semaphore with waiting tasks was released by a call of OS_Unuse().<br>
           This happened on CPUs which could not perform atomic pointer or 32bit operations.<br>
           The system might have crashed, or might not have activated tasks with higher priority.<br>
           The problem existed in all embOS versions since version 3.80i and is corrected with version 3.82w.<br>
           Usage of OS_UseTimed() might have caused the same problems on all CPUs when the timeout expired during the resource semaphore was freed and waiting tasks were activated from another task by calling OS_Unuse().
